# TD-Gambling | Tower Defense Game with Crates (2D, Pygame)

## Project Overview

This 2D Tower Defense game, developed with Python and the Pygame library, features exciting gameplay mechanics such as placing towers to defend against waves of enemies. Additionally, we have incorporated a gambling element: crates that you can purchase using an earned in-game currency. These crates contain random rewards, such as skins or new towers that you can level up as the game progresses.

The game is planned for PC and might later be ported to mobile devices.
